# W3C Docs CG

This is the repository for the [W3C Docs Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/docs-cg/). This group is an open community with the mission to ensure web developers and designers worldwide have the best information available so they can build things on the web platform. For more details, read our [charter](charter.md).

This group is open to anyone to join. If you would like to join, please visit [this](https://www.w3.org/community/docs-cg/join) page. You will be asked to create a W3C account if you do not have one already. If you are affiliated with a W3C Member organization then you will have to ask your Advisory Committee representative to add you to the group.

We are in the `#docs-cg` channel on the [W3C Community Slack](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/archives/C08KNG3GFEF) to organize and do work asynchronously between meetings. To get an invite to the W3C Community Slack, please visit [this](https://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite) page.

Our minutes are posted in this repo after every call.
