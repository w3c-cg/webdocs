## Notes

### Intros

- No intros needed

### Explainer horizontal review checklist

**Florian:** Last session we reviewed 3 explainers. We want to be more structured about it. Lola has prepared a checklist see https://github.com/w3c-cg/webdocs/issues/21

**Lola:**

- inspiration from privacy and a11y groups. They have list available to spec authors so they can use when writing.
- based on conversation from 2 weeks ago, every review should use the same rubric, and staying on what we should be focused on (documentation rather than the tech). Does it meet the requirements of what an explainer should be be? Open for additions/deletions. Reading code example as a way to know if the content makes sense to developers. Section on assessing the code examples: do the code examples explain how to use the feature.
- First time accessibility concept: can someone outside of those involved understand the content the explainer is explaining? Two minds:
  1. The explainer should be written for those who don't know the space. The spec written assuming the reader does know the space. If we assess by how accessible they are to readers. however, most don't meet this. Good explainers include definitions on terms, etc.,
  2. If we include this, it may be more work as most explainers don't meet this suggested requirement
- Conversation: is this something we should have?

**Florian:**
If there's no a11y for first readers, there should be links for the reader to find more information. when it's a new concept to the reader, having links to material on the topic even though it was not web related was really helpful. Was able to gain knowledge about compute pressure from non-web related links.

**Patrick:**
Maybe instead of "first time reader" it should be "first read by a tech writer" - people with some knowledge and experience writing, rather than none.

**Florian:**
translation from tech into documentation. if TAG can't understand it we have a problem.

**Lola:**
It will be read by us, TAG, privacy space people, accessibility people. Should be readable by people in all those spaces. Everyone is technical, so maybe be more specific in our language about how technical. Maybe making sure there are resources, like a "what do I need to know" section.

**Florian:**
I guess we can be confident and say if a web docs tech writer can't understand the explainer then there is a problem with the explainer.

**Lola:**
if it's universally applicable? There are some very preliminary/incubation explainers. those will not be as fine-tuned as explainers for tech that is better supported / further along.

**Florian:**
You're right. There's not a lot in the incubation level explainers.

**Patrick:**
Further along? by definition, an explainer is not implemented

**Lola:**
often times the specification is much further along. Incubation vs. something with implementers is very different. For example, the age verification digital credentials APIs. Compared to proofreader API, but are not implemented, but one is hot so the explainer is further along.

**Patrick:**
We should spend the same amount of effort on each, not based on which step (incubation v. implementation) the process is on.

**Lola:**
digital credentials API is way past incubation (developed in the Federated Identity Working Group: https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/). Things are still being defined. In TAG we don't review if we don't have time / can't be useful / trust that team is working in the spirit of the web and we don't understand well enough to review.

**Florian:**
Add to our checklist / onto lola's issues that we can always skip an explainer. If it's too early, or other valid reason. 

### New explainers to review

**Florian:** Looked at design review repository and saw 3 new explainers.

Proofreader API: https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1146 says it's early
https://github.com/webmachinelearning/proofreader-api/blob/main/README.md has code example and goals

**Lola:**
internationalization was not included in the rubric. the proofreader explainer would require that. the examples are all in american english but this should have a review by internalization team.

**Lola:**
should this include a11y section?

**Patrick:**
my experience is that proofreading is all javascript. i don't think there is an interaction with the dom tree. 

**Lola:**
gives the developer tools, but doesn't output rendered

**Florian:**
can add html semantics manually. that's not part of the API so not in the explainer First explainer looks solid.

Second explainer is a comment regarding FedCM- https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1147

**Florian:**
I just reviewed FedCM so am familiar, but this mini explainer is very mini

**Lola:**
I shouldn't have to read a thread to understand what an explainer is saying.

**Florian:**
typically if something like this ships and this is the provided
explainer, a lot of research work will need to be done by the tech writer in order to get the context and the idea of the change.

**Lola:**
give us an actual document. should be in an accessible repository. should be with working group, but sometimes it's with the browser, good to have something to point them to say follow the process.

**Florian:**
what would we do with a not-good-enough explainer. Do we tell the author?

**Lola:**
that's why it's good to have a non-public repo. we don't want to give spec authors more bureaucracy. everything tht comes in design review should be reviewed. should ask the authors of the explainer of explainers.

**Florian:**
let's discuss how we handle feedback in the meeting in two weeks.

Third:  Google explainer -- https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1148

**Florian:**
some vendors have repos with a list of their explainers.
this is a real explainer but doesn't have any code examples.

**Francois:**
odd this is that this looks more like a bug than something needing an explainer. from a process perspective, when is going through this process needed. looks like something that could be fixed by working group itself

**Florian:**
not every bug fix to a spec gets an explainer. what is the bar to requiring an explainer? does every new idl addition require an explainer?

**Lola:**
sometimes people put explainers that look like bug fixes, but we review it and say "yeah, it's good" but we can say "we're not reviewing this" as it's not a new feature or adding a feature. Do we see anything in this explainer that would require documentation updates? Our rubric could be "if it impacts documentation". If yes, then we review. if no, we let it go.

**Florian:**
There are some compat concerns, so that hints that there may be some docs involved.
This has been a worthwhile exercise. We may come to structure and recommendations at some point.

**Lola:**
do we want to set a timeline or goal?

**Florian:**
we have 4 more sessions of this meeting before TPAC, when we'll meet with the TAG about this. If we keep reviewing 3 every two weeks, it will lead to a more informed discussion at TPAC. TPAC is the deadline where we can discuss in person and determine our role wrt explainers.
