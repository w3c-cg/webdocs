## Notes

- Dipika: Do we want to do a pilot review for an explainer?
- Lola: We can pick an explainer and try it out
- Lola: *summarizes discussions from last week*
- Lola: Co-owning the explainer-explainer doc
- Lola: Does the explainer properly explain the design?
- Dipika: What are they current review cycles?
- Dipika: What value do we bring to the table?
- Lola: The explainer gets send to several groups for review, e.g. a11y, privacy, TAG, etc.
- Lola: So for example, Digital Credentials API: has an outdated explainer only.
- Lola: The spec introduction is not enough.
- Florian: Will say the Digital Credential people listen to us if we say: "go update your explainer"
- Lola: TAG can block on horizontal reviews from the Docs CG
- Will: Docs CG can help to make things understandable
- Florian: People want to less process
- Lola: We are shifting the responsibilities from TAG to Docs CG for explainer, so not more process, rather saving everyone's time
- Lola: TAG just wants to technical design review
- Dipika: Show up as partners and be helpful to get a good explainer out
- Dipika: explainers get out of date quickly
- Lola: Explainer can live in the spec / in the introduction
- Lola: The problem is that the explainer in the introduction is not sufficient enough, they don't fill out the explainer template as they assume the spec itself explains things
- Florian: Lifecycle of explainers, see MS and Igalia indexes. Can explainers always be given a status?
- Will: What is the lifecycle here and what are the audiences?
- Lola: The explainers are usually written before the spec. the audiences can be different. Google may write internal explainers and then go public with them, other times it is publicly developed within W3C WGs.
- Lola: For spec updates, usually an explainer about the update gets written
- Dipika: Does all information from the explainer move to the spec? Code examples? Problem statements?
- Lola: Explainers are often high-level
- Lola: https://github.com/mfreed7/declarative-shadow-dom/blob/master/README.md is a very detailed explainer with code examples, and lots of information.
- Florian: Great explainer, speaking as Tech Writer this is great, but it is so hard to figure out if it is really what landed in the spec
- Will: There are aspects here that are probably quite stable, like the problem space is relatively stable, but the solution space might have seen some updates when it was integrated with the spec.
- Florian: Lets have a pilot review next Docs CG call. When is a good time for us to review explainers? How do we find good candidates
- Dipika: We should not be speaking to a void, so identifying which ones is important?
- Lola: People would send explainers to the Docs CG for review
- Lola: For piloting we can just look at one of the latest issues: https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues
- Lola: Let's pick a few explainers now
- Florian: Picking the latest 3:
   - Incubation: An Origin Object https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1130
   - Incubation: patching (interleaved out-of-order streaming) https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1134
   - Approximate Geolocation https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1131
- Florian: Reminder about our three TPAC sessions
