  - Lola to confirm agenda with TAG

  - Florian to talk to Dominique about what the focus of this session should be.
  - Some thoughts:
    - It negatively impacts traffic to doc sites
    - AI is more personalized to the dev than our generic writing to be inclusive of everyone
    - MCP protocols exist that can help systems be more effective
    - Not sure if in scope for this session, but AI tools are 'stealing' content, which impacts funding structures among other things
  
## Including i18n

- Lets invite the issue reporter to the TPAC session
- Let meet with i18n folks in a future Docs CG call
