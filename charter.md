# W3C Documentation CG Charter

## Mission

The mission of the W3C Documentation Community Group (W3C Docs CG) is to ensure web developers and designers worldwide have the best information available so they can build things on the web platform.

## Scope of work

This community group will:

- Plan and write new documentation for web platform technologies.
  - Make sure reference documentation (“the book of web platform features”) is complete.
  - Identify needs for guides, how-tos, and tutorials, and create them.
- Work with specification authors to define best practices for web developer documentation, code examples, and information architecture.
- Maintain and keep documentation up-to-date using modern approaches like docs-as-code
- Develop tools to create feedback loops between standards and web developer documentation.
- Coordinate documentation efforts: Collaborate with other W3C community groups, such as [WebDX](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/), [Security](https://www.w3.org/mission/security/), [Privacy](https://www.w3.org/mission/privacy/), [Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/mission/accessibility/), [Internationalization](https://www.w3.org/mission/internationalization/), [Sustainability](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/) and integrate their findings and best practices into documentation.
- Be a resource for resources: map documentation sources for web developers.
  - Identify reliable sources of information.
  - Invite them to be part of the conversations in this community group.
- Drive adoption (or deprecation) of web platform technologies:
  - Identify web platform features where sparse docs prevent adoption and understanding.
  - Interpret developer surveys (such as the [MDN short survey on web developer’s experience with Web Security](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/developer-research/blob/main/mdn-short-surveys/2023-05-15-security-dx/interpretation.md) and understand the role of documentation in identified shortcomings.
- Ensure documentation relevance: coordinate horizontal efforts to get outdated docs updated such as by helping reach out to the right docs owners.
- Be a hub for web documentation: when docs-related efforts, changes, and/or projects appear, coordinate with the relevant stakeholders to get these amplified.

## Key deliverables

- Write and maintain docs in [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content). See the [backlog](https://openwebdocs.github.io/web-docs-backlog/) for missing reference pages.
- Identify best practices for web developer documentation.
- Drive adoption and understanding of web technologies.

## Out of scope

The group may produce Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter but not Specifications.
